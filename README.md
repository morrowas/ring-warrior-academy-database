# Wrestling Gym Database Project
- Developed a web-based database management application enabling CRUD functionality.
- Designed and populated a relational database using SQL with at least 4 entities and relationships.
- Built a user interface to manage data tables with features such as dynamic drop-downs, plus SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE (with nullable foreign key relationships), and DELETE operations.
- Ensured data integrity in many-to-many relationships and implemented complex queries to handle foreign key constraints.
